## :black_nib: About :black_nib: ##
* This is a my coursework developed in PHP. Simple CRUD operations and authorization were requested.
* As a first step, the person visiting this website must register or if that person has an account, they can log in directly. We have two different pages, one for customers and the other for the owner.
* Every single person who registers on the website is by default considered as a customer account. The profiles that will have access to the admin page are determined by the Owner manually.
* If we log in as the owner of the site, it will welcome us to the admin panel where it will allow us to perform CRUD operations, you will also be able to delete a specific customer or manager account.
* When we log in as a customer, then it will automatically send us to the dedicated customer page, where we will browse all the products, filter them and add them to our cart.
